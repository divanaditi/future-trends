This requirement increases the complexity of design and materials, leading to potential cost surges during production.</li>    <li><strong>Market Competition:</strong> The market is crowded with numerous manufacturers offering a range of products. This saturation can drive down prices and necessitate unique selling propositions to stand out.</li>    <li><strong>Consumer Awareness:</strong> Many parents may not be fully aware of the benefits of outdoor playhouses.
