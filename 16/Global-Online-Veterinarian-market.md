Certain diagnoses require physical examinations, which restrict the services veterinarians can offer remotely.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Data Security Concerns:</strong>        The collection and management of pet health data raise privacy and security concerns. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures and compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR is paramount but can be costly.    </li></ul><h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2><ul>    <li>        <strong>Increased Acceptance of Telemedicine:</strong>        The growing acceptance of telemedicine can provide a substantial boost to the online veterinarian market.
