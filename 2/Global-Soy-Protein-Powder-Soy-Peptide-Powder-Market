<p class="">    <h1>Key Challenges in the Soy Protein Powder Market</h1>    <p>The soy protein powder market faces several significant challenges that impact its growth potential:</p>    <ul>        <li>            <strong>Consumer Perception:</strong> Many consumers harbor negative perceptions regarding soy protein, associating it with potential health risks. Concerns about phytoestrogens and GMO content contribute to hesitance in adopting soy-based products.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Market Competition:</strong> The rise of alternative protein sources, such as pea protein, hemp protein, and animal-based proteins, creates intense competition. These alternatives often boast cleaner labels or are perceived as healthier options.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong> The soy protein industry faces stringent regulations regarding labeling, nutritional claims, and safety assessments. Navigating this complex landscape can be cumbersome for manufacturers.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Supply Chain Volatility:</strong> Fluctuating soybean prices and environmental factors affecting crop yield pose risks to consistency in supply. Trade policies and tariffs can also impact market dynamics, creating unpredictability.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Allergen Concerns:</strong> Soy allergy is a common concern among consumers, leading to limitations in target market expansion.
