Retaining skilled employees has become a core challenge for many organizations.</li>    <li><strong>Technological Adaptation:</strong> While technology has transformed the staffing sector, many firms struggle to adapt. Failure to incorporate advanced recruitment tools, such as AI and data analytics, can lead to inefficiencies in matching candidates with job requirements.</li>    <li><strong>Changing Candidate Expectations:</strong> Modern job seekers have evolving expectations regarding company culture, work-life balance, and growth opportunities. Companies must align their offerings to meet these demands or risk losing out on potential hires.</li>    <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Navigating the complex landscape of labor laws and regulations can pose challenges for staffing agencies.
