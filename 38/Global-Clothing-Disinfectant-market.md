This presents a challenge for manufacturers to develop new formulations that mitigate this risk.        </li>    </ul>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2>    <ul>        <li>             <strong>Innovation in Formulations:</strong>             Developing advanced, multi-functional formulations that not only disinfect but also offer stain removal, odor control, and fabric care can attract more consumers looking for comprehensive solutions.        </li>        <li>             <strong>Eco-friendly Products:</strong>             Increasing demand for sustainable and natural products presents an opportunity for brands to differentiate themselves. Creating eco-conscious disinfectants can appeal to environmentally aware consumers.        </li>        <li>             <strong>Personalization and Customization:</strong>             Offering customizable options based on fabric type or specific use cases (e.g., sports gear, childrenâ€™s clothing) can enhance consumer engagement and meet diverse needs.        </li>        <li>             <strong>Online Retail Expansion:</strong>             The shift toward e-commerce presents a significant growth opportunity.
