Collaborations with dermatologists and influencers can enhance credibility and reach different demographics.</p><h2>4. E-commerce Growth</h2><p>The rise of e-commerce provides an avenue to reach more consumers. Direct-to-consumer models can help brands build relationships and understand consumer preferences, leading to innovative offerings.</p><h2>5.
