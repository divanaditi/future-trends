Companies must navigate complex regulatory environments, which can delay product launches and increase costs.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Consumer Awareness:</strong> Despite the availability of various treatment options, many consumers remain unaware of the benefits and efficacy of scar gels. This lack of awareness can hinder market growth as potential users may opt for unverified home remedies.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Variable Efficacy:</strong> The efficacy of scar gels can vary greatly between individuals due to differences in skin types, scar types, and adherence to treatment regimens.
