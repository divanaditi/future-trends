Compliance with these regulations can be both time-consuming and costly for practitioners.</li>    <li><strong>Patient Safety Concerns:</strong> Increasing patient awareness of potential risks associated with cosmetic procedures can result in hesitancy. High-profile complications and malpractice claims have led to heightened scrutiny, affecting overall industry reputation.</li>    <li><strong>Market Saturation:</strong> With the proliferation of clinics offering cosmetic procedures, particularly in urban areas, market saturation can drive competition significantly.

This disparity can create inconsistency in service quality and patient outcomes, impacting overall market trust.</li>    <li><strong>Changing Consumer Preferences:</strong> The rise of natural and less invasive beauty trends poses challenges for traditional surgical procedures.
