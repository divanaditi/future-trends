Educational initiatives are needed to highlight the benefits of DEBs.</li>    <li><strong>Competition with Alternative Therapies:</strong> The prevalence of alternative treatment options, such as drug-eluting stents and other cardiovascular interventions, poses a competitive challenge. Clinicians may prefer established methods over newer technologies.</li>    <li><strong>Regulatory Compliances Post-Market:</strong> Manufacturers must ensure ongoing compliance with changing regulations and safety standards, which can lead to increased operational costs and potential penalties for non-compliance.</li></ul><h2>Potential Growth Opportunities in the DEB Market</h2><p>Despite these challenges, the DEB market presents various growth opportunities:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> Innovations in materials and drug formulations can enhance the efficacy and safety profiles of DEBs.
