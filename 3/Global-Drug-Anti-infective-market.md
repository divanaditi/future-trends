The costs associated with lengthy clinical trials, coupled with the risk of failed trials, can deter innovation in this sector.</li>        <li><strong>Market Saturation:</strong> With many existing anti-infective treatments, particularly in well-established categories, there is intense competition. This saturation can restrict the potential for market entry for new players or products.</li>        <li><strong>Access and Affordability:</strong> While new therapies are developed, access to these medications can be limited in many regions due to cost and availability, impacting overall market growth.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2>    <ul>        <li><strong>Novel Drug Development:</strong> There is a growing demand for new anti-infective agents that can combat resistant bacteria.
