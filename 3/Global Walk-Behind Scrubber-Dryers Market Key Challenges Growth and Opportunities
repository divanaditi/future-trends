<p class=""><h2>Key Challenges in the Walk-Behind Scrubber-Dryers Market</h2><p>The <strong>walk-behind scrubber-dryers market</strong> faces a series of challenges that pose significant barriers to growth. One notable challenge is the <em>high initial cost</em> of purchasing these machines. This can deter small to medium-sized enterprises from investing in scrubber-dryers, affecting overall market penetration.</p><p>Another pain point is <em>maintenance and reliability</em>.
