Sustainable practices not only reduce waste but can also appeal to environmentally-conscious consumers and businesses.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Growth in Artisan and Craft Baking:</strong> The rising popularity of artisanal and craft baked goods creates demand for high-quality, efficient dough processing equipment. Companies can exploit this trend by designing specialized sheeters tailored for artisanal bakers.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Expansion in Emerging Markets:</strong> As developing countries witness a surge in bakery establishments and a growing middle class, there is potential for market expansion.
