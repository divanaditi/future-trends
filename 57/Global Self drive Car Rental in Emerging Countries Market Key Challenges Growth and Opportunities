This can hinder the use of apps and platforms necessary for modern car rental services.</p><h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2><p>Despite these challenges, the self-drive car rental market in emerging countries presents numerous growth opportunities. One major avenue for growth is the increasing <strong>urbanization</strong> trend. As cities expand and populations grow, the demand for flexible transportation solutions rises, creating a niche for self-drive car rentals to thrive.</p><p>Another opportunity lies in the <strong>growth of smart city initiatives</strong>.

Collaborating with local startups can provide innovative solutions tailored to regional challenges, driving further acceptance and adoption.</p><p>Lastly, the growing concern for <strong>sustainability</strong> presents an opportunity for self-drive car rentals to promote electric and hybrid vehicles, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.
