Technological Advancements:</h3>    <p>        The rapid pace of technological advancement creates a barrier for manufacturers to keep up, particularly in terms of         integrating smart capabilities and automation in their products. This lag can result in losing market share to         more innovative competitors.    </p>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities in the Heavy Duty Mixer Grinder Market</h2>    <p>        Despite the challenges, several growth opportunities exist that companies can leverage.    </p>    <h3>1.
