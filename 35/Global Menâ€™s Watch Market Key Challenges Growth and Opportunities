Many consumers, especially younger demographics, prioritize functionality over luxury, which could alienate traditional watchmakers.  </li>  <li>    <strong>Market Saturation:</strong> With an overwhelming number of options available, consumers may experience decision fatigue, leading to longer purchase cycles. Brands struggle to differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace.  </li>  <li>    <strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> Global supply chain issues, accelerated by recent world events, pose a significant threat to manufacturers.
