Small to medium-sized producers may struggle with the administrative burden, limiting their ability to compete.</li>    <li><strong>Market Awareness:</strong> While demand is increasing, the awareness of the benefits of organic linen is not uniform across all consumer segments. Many potential buyers remain unaware of the environmental and health benefits associated with organic textiles.</li>    <li><strong>Environmental Impact of Production:</strong> Despite being more sustainable than conventional textiles, the production of organic linen can still have an environmental footprint.
