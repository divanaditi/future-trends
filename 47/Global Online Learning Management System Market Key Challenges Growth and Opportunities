Organizations often face difficulties in curating relevant materials that meet diverse learner needs, leading to a general decline in perceived value.</li>    <li><strong>Data Privacy and Security:</strong> With rising concerns regarding data privacy, educational institutions must ensure that learners' data are adequately protected, which often requires significant investment and effort.</li>    <li><strong>Scalability Issues:</strong> As organizations grow, their LMS needs may change.
