Fluctuations in raw material costs, such as grapes and other ingredients, directly impact pricing strategies, making it difficult for producers to maintain profitability.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Competition:</strong>            The market is saturated with various brands and labels; this intense competition complicates differentiation efforts. New entrants often struggle to establish a foothold amidst well-established brands with strong consumer loyalty.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong>            The wine industry is subject to stringent regulations regarding labeling, production, and distribution. Compliance can be burdensome, particularly for smaller producers in the low-grade segment who may lack resources for dedicated legal support.        </li>    </ul></section><section>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2>    <ul>        <li>            <strong>Innovative Marketing Strategies:</strong>            Leveraging social media and digital marketing can create brand awareness and shift the perception of low-grade white wines.
