The shift towards plant-based substitutes requires companies to innovate rapidly.</li>        <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Maintaining consistent quality and flavor profile is crucial but challenging due to variations in raw materials. Issues related to spoilage, freshness, and processing techniques can undermine product quality.</li>        <li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> The global nature of seafood sourcing makes the industry vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Economic fluctuations or geopolitical tensions can significantly affect sourcing costs and availability.</li>    </ul>    <h1>Potential Growth Opportunities in the Seafood Extract and Flavor Market</h1>    <p>Despite the challenges, there are several growth opportunities within this dynamic sector:</p>    <ul>        <li><strong>Plant-Based Alternatives:</strong> The rising trend of plant-based diets opens opportunities for the development of seafood flavoring derived from plants, appealing to a broader consumer base.
