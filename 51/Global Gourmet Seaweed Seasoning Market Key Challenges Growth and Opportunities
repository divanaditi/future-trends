Ensuring sustainable collection practices is essential to maintain the industry’s credibility and long-term viability.</li>    <li><strong>Regulatory Hurdles:</strong> Navigating food safety regulations and obtaining necessary certifications can prove cumbersome for manufacturers. This can hinder product development and speed to market, especially for new entrants.</li>    <li><strong>Flavor Profile Adaptation:</strong> While seaweed offers unique and umami-rich flavors, some consumers may initially find them unfamiliar or off-putting. Educating consumers on flavor pairing and cooking methods is crucial to overcoming this psychological barrier.</li>    <li><strong>Market Competition:</strong> The market faces increasing competition from other gourmet seasonings and flavor enhancers, which can overshadow gourmet seaweed.
