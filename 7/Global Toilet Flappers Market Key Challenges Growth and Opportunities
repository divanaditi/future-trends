The challenge lies in meeting these regulations while maintaining product effectiveness.</li></ul><h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2><p>Despite the challenges, the toilet flappers market presents several emerging opportunities:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Innovations:</strong> Expansion into biodegradable or recyclable materials can attract environmentally-conscious consumers.
