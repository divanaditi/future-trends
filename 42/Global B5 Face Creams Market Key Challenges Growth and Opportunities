This leads to intense competition, making it difficult for new entrants to establish a foothold.</li>        <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Strict regulations and guidelines governing cosmetic products can pose a significant challenge for manufacturers. Navigating these regulations can be time-consuming and costly, particularly for smaller companies.</li>        <li><strong>Consumer Skepticism:</strong> Many consumers are becoming more educated about skincare ingredients and are skeptical about marketing claims. Building trust and transparency in ingredient sourcing and efficacy is crucial in overcoming this challenge.</li>        <li><strong>Rising Ingredient Costs:</strong> The cost of high-quality ingredients, including Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) and other active compounds, has been rising. This can squeeze profit margins and lead to increased retail prices, potentially alienating price-sensitive consumers.</li>        <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> Growing environmental consciousness among consumers is prompting brands to adopt sustainable practices.
