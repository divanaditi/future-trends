One of the most significant opportunities lies in <em>expanding treatment indications</em>. By exploring additional uses for Azvudine, such as in combination therapies or for new patient populations, the market can tap into previously unaddressed segments.</p>    <p>Moreover, the increasing prevalence of diseases that Azvudine targets presents another opportunity. As more patients seek effective treatment options, the demand for Azvudine could rise, particularly in regions where healthcare infrastructure is improving.</p>    <p>Emerging <em>biotechnology advancements</em> also offer a pathway for innovation in the Azvudine market. Collaborations with research institutions can foster new insights and enhance the therapeutic profile of Azvudine, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.</p>    <p>Finally, the growth of <em>telemedicine</em> and patient-centric care can facilitate greater access to treatments like Azvudine.
