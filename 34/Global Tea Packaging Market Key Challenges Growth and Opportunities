Supply Chain Disruptions</h2>    <p>Global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain, leading to delays and increased costs in obtaining materials for packaging. Continual disruptions can hinder production efficiency.</p>    <h2>3. Regulatory Compliance</h2>    <p>The tea packaging sector must adhere to stringent food safety and packaging regulations across different regions. Compliance requires investment in high-quality materials and processes to avoid penalties and maintain consumer trust.</p>    <h2>4. Rising Raw Material Costs</h2>    <p>Fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, such as paper and plastics, pose a financial burden.
