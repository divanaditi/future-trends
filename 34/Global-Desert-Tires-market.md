Manufacturers must invest in sustainable practices and materials, which can increase operational costs.</li>    <li><strong>Competition from Alternative Solutions:</strong> The rise of alternative traction solutions, such as specialized all-terrain tires, can threaten traditional desert tire manufacturers. Companies must innovate to differentiate their products and highlight unique selling points.</li>    <li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> Recent global events have exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains, impacting the availability of essential components and leading to delays.
