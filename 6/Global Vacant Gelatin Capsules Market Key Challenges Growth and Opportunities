Compliance with regulations such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and FDA guidelines is essential but can be costly and time-consuming.</li>        <li><strong>Raw Material Sourcing:</strong> The sourcing of high-quality gelatin can be problematic due to fluctuations in the availability of animal byproducts and regulations regarding animal welfare. This creates instability in raw material costs, affecting profit margins for manufacturers.</li>        <li><strong>Vegan and Vegetarian Demand:</strong> There is an increasing consumer preference for plant-based products. Traditional gelatin capsules, derived from animal products, are facing declining demand. Manufacturers must adapt to this shift or risk losing market share.</li>        <li><strong>Competition from Alternative Delivery Systems:</strong> The rise of alternative dosage forms, such as tablets, gummies, and liquid formulations, poses a significant challenge to the gelatin capsule market. These alternatives may offer better bioavailability or consumer appeal, leading to potential losses in market share for gelatin capsules.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Potential Growth Opportunities in the Vacant Gelatin Capsules Market</h3>    <ul>        <li><strong>Development of Plant-Based Capsules:</strong> As consumers become more health-conscious and environmentally aware, there is a growing demand for vegetarian and vegan capsule options.
