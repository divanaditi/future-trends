This can limit the lifespan of older models and discourage potential buyers                 from investing in used equipment.            </li>            <li>                <strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> Continuous developments in forklift technology may make                 older models obsolete. Buyers often prefer newer technologies with advanced features, putting pressure                 on older IC cushion forklifts to compete.            </li>        </ul>    </p>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities in the Used IC Cushion Forklift Truck Market</h1>    <p>        Despite these challenges, there are several emerging opportunities for growth in the used IC cushion         forklift truck market:        <ul>            <li>                <strong>Refurbishment Services:</strong> Offering refurbished forklifts can meet the demand for                 cost-effective yet reliable options.
