As producers prioritize healthy livestock to enhance yield, the demand for effective treatments like Rafoxanide is likely to rise.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Resistant Parasite Solutions:</strong>            Developing combination therapies or alternative delivery systems could address resistance issues. Innovations in formulations, such as slow-release mechanisms, may also enhance product efficacy and longevity in the market.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Expanding Livestock Markets:</strong>            Emerging markets have a growing livestock sector, creating potential demand for veterinary treatments. Strategies targeting these regions can facilitate market penetration and increased sales.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Online Distribution Channels:</strong>            The shift toward digital channels for veterinary product sales offers an avenue for growth.
