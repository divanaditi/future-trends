The scarcity of qualified professionals hampers the effective implementation of ITSM strategies.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Changing Technology Landscape:</strong> Rapid technological advancements, including AI and automation, necessitate continuous learning and adaptation. Organizations may find it challenging to keep their ITSM frameworks relevant amid evolving technologies.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Customer Expectations:</strong> Modern consumers demand seamless, omnichannel support experiences. Meeting these expectations requires firms to enhance their IT service delivery, posing a challenge for traditional ITSM approaches.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Adherence to increasing regulatory requirements can complicate ITSM processes.
