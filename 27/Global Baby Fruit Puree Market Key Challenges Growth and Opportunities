Maintaining product flavor, texture, and nutritional integrity while extending shelf life is crucial for consumer acceptance.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> Global supply chain issues can impact the availability and cost of raw materials. This can lead to increased prices for consumers and potential shortages of popular products, hindering growth.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Market Saturation:</strong> As more brands enter the baby food sector, the market has become increasingly saturated.

Direct-to-consumer models can also foster better customer relationships and increase profit margins.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Targeted Marketing Campaigns:</strong> Leveraging social media and influencer partnerships could help engage younger parents and create an authentic community around brands. Tailoring messaging to emphasize health and convenience can drive consumer demand.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Exploration of International Markets:</strong> Many emerging markets have an increasing demand for baby food products.
