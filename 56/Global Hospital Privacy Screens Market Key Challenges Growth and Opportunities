<p class=""><h2>Key Challenges in the Hospital Privacy Screens Market</h2><ul>    <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Hospitals must navigate a complex landscape of regulations regarding patient privacy, which can complicate the design and installation of privacy screens.

Ensuring longevity while maintaining privacy can be a challenge for manufacturers.</li>        <li><strong>Space Constraints:</strong> Many hospitals face spatial limitations, particularly in older facilities where expanding patient areas is not feasible. This restricts the installation of traditional screen solutions, urging a need for more adaptable designs.</li>        <li><strong>Budget Constraints:</strong> Healthcare budgets are often tight, leading to a reluctance in investing in privacy solutions. Hospitals prioritize essential care services, which can hinder the procurement of quality privacy screens.</li>        <li><strong>Inadequate Staff Training:</strong> Effective utilization of privacy screens requires proper training for healthcare personnel.
