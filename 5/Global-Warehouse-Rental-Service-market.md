<p class=""><h1>Key Challenges in the Warehouse Rental Service Market</h1><ul>    <li><strong>Increasing Rental Costs:</strong> The escalating costs associated with leasing warehouse space continue to be a major challenge for businesses, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises.

Maintaining outdated facilities can deter potential tenants looking for modern solutions.</li>    <li><strong>Compliance and Regulations:</strong> Navigating complex regulations concerning safety, labor, and environmental practices can be daunting. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties and affect a company's reputation.</li>    <li><strong>Labor Shortages:</strong> The industry is facing a persistent labor shortage, complicating operations in warehouse management.
