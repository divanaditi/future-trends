<p class=""><h1>Key Challenges in the Decorative Accessories Market</h1><p>The decorative accessories market faces several key challenges that can hinder growth and profitability:</p><ul>    <li>        <strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> Recent global events have highlighted vulnerabilities in supply chains, leading to delays in production and shipping. Disruptions impact inventory levels and product availability, affecting retailer relationships and consumer satisfaction.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Market Saturation:</strong> An influx of brands and products has led to a saturated market, making it difficult for businesses to differentiate their offerings. Competition on price can erode profit margins, compelling companies to invest heavily in marketing.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Changing Consumer Preferences:</strong> The rise of minimalist and sustainable living trends has shifted consumer tastes.
