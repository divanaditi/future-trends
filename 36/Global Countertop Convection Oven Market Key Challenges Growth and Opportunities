This often results in price wars, which can negatively affect profit margins.</li>        <li><strong>Consumer Awareness:</strong> Many consumers remain unaware of the benefits of convection cooking compared to conventional methods. This lack of knowledge limits market growth as potential customers may stick to familiar cooking devices.</li>        <li><strong>Product Differentiation:</strong> With many similar products available, standing out in the marketplace can be challenging. Brands must invest significantly in innovative features to differentiate their products, which increases development costs.</li>        <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Manufacturers face strict regulations regarding product safety, energy efficiency, and emissions. Adhering to these regulations can be both time-consuming and costly, affecting the ability to bring new products to market swiftly.</li>        <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> Economic downturns can curtail consumer spending on non-essential kitchen appliances. As cooking styles evolve, fluctuations in disposable income can significantly impact sales.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Growth Opportunities</h2>    <ul>        <li><strong>Health-Conscious Cooking:</strong> The increasing emphasis on healthy eating presents a growth opportunity.
