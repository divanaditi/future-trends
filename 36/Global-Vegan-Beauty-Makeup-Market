This lack of understanding can hinder market growth as potential customers may overlook vegan options.    </li>    <li>      <strong>Sourcing Ingredients:</strong> Finding high-quality, vegan ingredients can be challenging. Manufacturers often struggle to source sustainable and ethical plant-based materials that maintain product effectiveness and appeal.    </li>    <li>      <strong>Price Sensitivity:</strong> Vegan beauty products tend to be priced higher than conventional makeup. This presents a barrier for price-sensitive consumers who may opt for more affordable alternatives, limiting market penetration.    </li>    <li>      <strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong> Navigating the regulatory landscape can be complex, especially for new entrants. Compliance with various cosmetic regulations while ensuring vegan certification can be a daunting task.    </li>    <li>      <strong>Market Saturation:</strong> As the demand for vegan products increases, the market is becoming saturated with new brands.
