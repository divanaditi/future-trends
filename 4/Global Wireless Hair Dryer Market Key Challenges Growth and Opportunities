This higher price point can deter budget-conscious consumers from making a purchase.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Charging Infrastructure:</strong> The need for charging infrastructure can be a hurdle. Consumers may find it inconvenient to have to recharge their hair dryer or carry a charger, especially when traveling.        </li>    </ul>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities in the Wireless Hair Dryer Market</h2>    <ul>        <li>            <strong>Advancements in Battery Technology:</strong> As technology evolves, advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries, present opportunities for longer-lasting, lightweight, and more efficient wireless hair dryers.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Sustainability Trends:</strong> Eco-friendly products are gaining traction among consumers.
