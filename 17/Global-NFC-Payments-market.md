Integration issues can hinder adoption rates and limit the potential of this payment method.</li>        <li><strong>Consumer Awareness:</strong> Despite the increasing usage of NFC payments, a significant portion of the population remains unaware of how to use this technology effectively. A lack of understanding can lead to hesitance in adoption and usage among consumers.</li>        <li><strong>Interoperability Standards:</strong> The NFC payments ecosystem currently lacks universally accepted standards, which can lead to compatibility issues between devices and systems. This fragmentation can hinder the growth and deployment of NFC technology.</li>        <li><strong>Transaction Limits and Costs:</strong> Some NFC payment systems impose transaction limits or associated fees, which may deter users from adopting this payment method for larger purchases. High operational costs for merchants can also restrict widespread acceptance.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2>    <ul>        <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> As NFC technology continues to evolve, innovative solutions such as tokenization and encryption methods improve security, making consumers feel safer while transacting.
