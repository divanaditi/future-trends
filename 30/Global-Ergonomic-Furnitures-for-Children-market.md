Variants that cater to different ages and body types can attract diverse consumer segments.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Technological Integration:</strong>             Incorporating technology into ergonomic furniture, such as adjustable features and smart sensors, can enhance user experience. This tech-savvy approach can be particularly appealing to tech-oriented families.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Partnerships with Educational Institutions:</strong>             Collaborating with schools and educational organizations for bulk fittings can boost market presence and credibility. Schools prioritizing student health may be more inclined to invest in ergonomic options.        </li>        <li>            <strong>Promoting Health Benefits:</strong>             A strategic marketing approach that emphasizes the long-term health benefits of ergonomic furniture can persuade parents.
