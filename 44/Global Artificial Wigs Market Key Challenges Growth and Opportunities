Many potential customers perceive high-quality wigs as a luxury rather than an accessible product, limiting market penetration.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Changing Fashion Trends:</strong> The fast-paced nature of fashion trends poses a challenge for wig manufacturers. Companies must continuously innovate and adapt their offerings to keep up with shifting consumer preferences, which can strain resources and increase operational costs.    </li>    <li>        <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Adherence to safety and quality regulations across different countries can complicate production.
