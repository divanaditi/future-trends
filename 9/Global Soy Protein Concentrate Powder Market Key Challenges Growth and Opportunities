Soy protein concentrate can have an off-flavor and gritty texture, leading to demand for improvements in product formulations to enhance sensory attributes.</li>        <li><strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong> Stringent regulations concerning food safety, labeling, and sustainable sourcing create complexity for manufacturers. Navigating these regulations can be time-consuming and costly, impacting small to medium-sized enterprises disproportionately.</li>        <li><strong>Price Volatility:</strong> The soy market is subject to fluctuations due to weather conditions, crop yields, and geopolitical factors. This volatility can lead to unpredictable pricing, which impacts product profitability and availability.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Potential Growth Opportunities</h2>    <ul>        <li><strong>Increased Demand for Plant-Based Diets:</strong> A rising health consciousness and a shift toward plant-based diets present significant growth opportunities.
